Hi ,

Thanks for trying Loomio.

If you need more time, just ask to extend your free trial.

Use Loomio to increase engagement, save precious time in meetings and keep a record of your important decisions.

Here's a reminder of what you can expect when choosing one of our plans:

    Our cloud service Loomio Starter is great for getting started at just $25/month or $199/year*
    If you're a community group with no paid staff, Loomio is only $10/month or $199/lifetime*

*Prices in USD and terms and conditions apply.

If it hasn't worked out, we look forward to welcoming you back again at any time :-)

Warm regards, Michael
