Hi #{first_name},

Use Loomio to involve people in decisions.

[See the Simple decision process - 3 steps to making good collaborative decisions.](https://help.loomio.com/en/user_manual/polls/decisions/index.html?utm_campaign=trial&utm_medium=email)

## Raise an issue and make a decision

When an issue crops up that needs the attention of your group, outline it with a Loomio thread and invite people to comment, ask questions and contribute suggestions.  Test ideas with a __Sense check__ poll, and as a solution emerges, use a __proposal__ to get clear agreement.

- Raise an issue and invite feedback from your group.
- Formulate a response and test it with Sense check.
- Make a decision to proceed with a proposal.

The free trial of your Loomio group is about to expire. If you need more time, just reply and ask for an extension :-)  

[Go to your Loomio group and upgrade now.](https://www.loomio.com/dashboard/?utm_campaign=trial&utm_medium=email)

Do you have any questions or need further info?

Warm regards, Michael
