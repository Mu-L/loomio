Hi ,

Thanks for trying Loomio - a safe working space to exchange ideas, discuss issues and involve people in decisions. 

As we have not heard from you, I presume the trial didn’t work out? 

If so, we’re sorry to see you go and look forward to welcoming you back again at any time :-)

Please tell us about your trial experience. Was there something missing? 

Our mission at Loomio is to make it easy for anyone, anywhere, to participate in decisions that affect them.  

For a limited time you can still [go to your Loomio group](https://www.loomio.com/dashboard/?utm_campaign=trial&utm_medium=email) here to upgrade.

Warm regards, Michael

PS. This is the last email in our trial support series.
