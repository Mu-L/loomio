Discussing a topic on Loomio

What is the topic that you need to discuss? 
In Loomio, generally, the process is start a thread so you can have a discussion.
This gives people an opportunity to add information, ask questions and share their perspective or needs.

The blank thread template, will notify everyone in the group, they can reply by email, so .. really it's just as easy to pariticpate as if you had sent an email.
More often than not, a thread is enough. You don't need to start a proposal and make a decision. This is a good thing, because (and I'm being rather real here) decision making is an expensive process.

Is there a topic that you need to discuss, that you want to make a decision about?

Start a thread with a title like: "Waht are we going to do about the vacant lot"


The next email is all about proposals. You'll hear from me in 2 days.
