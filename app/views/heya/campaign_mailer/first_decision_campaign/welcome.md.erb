Hello, #{name}

Robert from Loomio here. I'm a co-founder and the lead developer on the team.

I'm writing to welcome you to Loomio, introduce myself as a contact person, and help you make your first decision on Loomio.

This is the first of 4 emails intended to help you make your first Loomio decision. Now, I should let you know that these emails are a work in progress - so if something is missing, or you have a question, please reply and let me know.

So, you've started a trial on Loomio, that's great... But, how do get to your first decision? There are 5 steps in the process, and ideally, you'll complete up to step 3 today.

### 1. Give your group a nice picture and description

√ You've already provided a group description! Well done!

This step is optional but highly encouraged. Upload a background image and logo for your group, and fill in the group description, so people know why you're inviting them to Loomio.
Bare minimum: Go find a group photo from your last meetup and upload it as the cover photo

### 2. Invite a few people to join

√ You've invited 8 people to the group. Excellent work!

In the trial you can invite up to 10 people. Hopefully this is enough for your first decision. If not, hit reply and I can increase this for you.
Invite a handful of people who can help you evaluate Loomio and see if it's the right fit for your organization.

### 3. Start a discussion thread

This is what I'll focus on
It's best if you already have a topic you need to discuss the topic, and allow people to contribute their perspectives. I'll focus on this step today.

### 4. Make a proposal

A Proposal outlines something that people can vote on within a fixed time limit. My next email will be a deep dive introduction on proposals.

### 5. Share an outcome

Loomio does not decide the outcome of a proposal, that's up to you. Sharing an outcome means to review votes and any supporting statements made about your proposal, and explain what will happen next.

And this point you may be able to say that a decision is made; having had a discussion, sought feedback on a proposal and summarisign the results.

Ok, if you have not already, update your group description and invite the relevant people to join your group. Tomorrow I'll discuss starting your first thread.
