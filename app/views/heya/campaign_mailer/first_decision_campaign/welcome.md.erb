Hello, #{name}

I'm Robert from Loomio.

I'm writing to welcome you to Loomio, introduce myself as a contact person if you have any questions, and help you make your first decision on Loomio.

This is the first of 3 emails intended to help you make your first Loomio decision. They're a work in progress - so if something is missing or you have a question, please reply and let me know.

So, what do you need to do to make a decision on Loomio?

To get from where you are now, having just started a trial, there are 5 key steps:

1. Give your group a nice picture and description
This step is optional but highly encouraged. Upload a background image and logo for your group, and fill in the group description, so people know why you're inviting them to Loomio.
√ You've already provided a group description! Well done!

2. Invite a few people to join
In the trial you can invite up to 10 people. Hopefully this is enough for your first decision. If not, hit reply and I can increase this for you.
√ You've invited 8 people to the group. Excellent work!

3. Start a thread - have a conversation about the topic
Before launching a proposal, it's a good idea to introduce the topic, and allow people to contribute their perspectives.

4. Run a proposal - suggest a course of action, measure the level of agreement and get succinct feedback within a fixed timeframe
Proposals are where the voting happens. They're time limited and there's plenty of options. A proposal finishes with an outcome.

5. Share an outcome - summarise the results and explain what what will happen next
This is really where the decision lives. Proposals suggest a course of action, but outcomes define the results.
In Loomio, it's up to you (or the proposal author) to decide how to interpret the results of a vote. So after a proposal has closed, you review the votes and statements, and say how you'll proceed.

For day 1, it's best to complete all the way to step 3.

Bare minimum: Go find a group photo from your last meetup and upload it as the cover photo

Invite a handful of people who can help you evaluate Loomio and see if it's the right fit for your organization.

Start a thread:

Is there a topic that you need to discuss, that you want to make a decision about?
Start a thread with a title like: "Waht are we going to do about the vacant lot"


The next email is all about proposals. You'll hear from me in 2 days.
