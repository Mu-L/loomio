Hi #{first_name},

I’m Michael, and want to thank you for upgrading to a Loomio subscription plan.  This is the start of our collaboration together!

Let me make some suggestions to help you set Loomio up for success in your organization.  I’ll send you some emails over the next week or so to help you set up and organize your group, invite people, discuss topics, progress work and make a collaborative decision.

If there is anything in particular you need help with, please let me know.

[Loomio Help](https://help.loomio.com/en/user_manual/getting_started/index.html?utm_campaign=onboard&utm_medium=email) is a good place to start.  You will see a short video where I walk through some examples of how people use Loomio to make decisions, share news and events and prepare for meetings.

Role of the admin
If you started the Loomio group you are the first administrator of the group.  You can make other people admins.  Admins have a special role in Loomio, and are usually the people responsible for introducing and helping people in your Loomio group.

Group Settings
As admin, it’s worth checking that the [Group Settings](https://help.loomio.com/en/user_manual/groups/settings/index.html?utm_campaign=onboard&utm_medium=email) are right for you.  Adding a photo or image for your group will help people arriving into the group feel at home.  Use the group description to say what you will use Loomio to do, and how you expect members to participate.

Privacy and Permissions
Take particular note of your group [Privacy and Permissions](https://help.loomio.com/en/user_manual/groups/settings/index.html#privacy?utm_campaign=onboard&utm_medium=email). Loomio offers a range of options for the visibility of your group from Secret to Open.  Consider carefully what permissions you grant to group members - in new groups, large networks or communities you may want to restrict permissions to keep everyone safe.

- [The Facilitator's Guide to Loomi](https://help.loomio.com/en/guides/facilitators_guide/index.html?utm_campaign=onboard&utm_medium=email) if you are engaging a network or group toward an intended outcome.


Let’s connect!  I can help further if you tell me a little about your organization and what you need to achieve with Loomio.

Warm regards, Michael
