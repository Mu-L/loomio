Hi #{first_name},

Here are some suggestions to help you introduce Loomio to your organization :-)

Inviting people to join your Loomio group is a critical step to success.  Let them know why you are using Loomio and use the group description to welcome people when they arrive, encouraging them to give it a go.

## Invite people
You can [invite](https://help.loomio.com/en/user_manual/groups/membership/index.html?utm_campaign=onboard&utm_medium=email) particular people to your group with their email address or share a link to your group via email, newsletter, chat or from your website.  You can keep an eye on how people are joining your group from the Members tab, and resend the invitation if necessary.

## Signing in to Loomio
Most people find it easy to sign in to Loomio with their email address on a computer, tablet or phone.  Send people to the [Signing in to Loomio](https://help.loomio.com/en/user_manual/users/sign_in/index.html?utm_campaign=onboard&utm_medium=email) page if they have any problems.

## How to participate in Loomio
Once signed in, [help people participate](https://help.loomio.com/en/user_manual/getting_started/write-a-comment.html?utm_campaign=onboard&utm_medium=email) by encouraging them to write a comment in a thread and vote in a poll.  Sometimes an ice-breaker thread and poll can help.  It also helps to quickly get people focused on the work that matters - moving discussion and decision workflows into Loomio.

## Orientation
The [Orientation tour](https://help.loomio.com/en/user_manual/getting_started/orientation.html?utm_campaign=onboard&utm_medium=email) is a useful overview for people new to Loomio; for example how Loomio works, where to find and change user profile settings, notifications and finding info in Loomio.
