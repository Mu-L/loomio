Hi ,

Loomio offers you a wide range of polling tools to help you progress a discussion to an outcome.

You can use polls to get engagement, test ideas, and to clarify an issue. If people are not engaged, or the discussion stalls without a clear way forwards, a poll can help to get it going again.

Here are three of my favorite poll types:

## Opt-in
Looking for people to join a working group, committee or the organizing team for an event?   

The Opt-in poll is a quick way of asking people to participate in a project or team.

## Sense check
Want to know what people think?   The Sense check poll is an easy way to get feedback on a proposal before things get finalized - clarify and improve an idea before moving to a decision.

Sense check lets people know a decision is coming and encourages them to engage. It is an opportunity to listen to people, sense how they feel and respond - to incorporate their contributions and make a better decision.


## Time poll
Struggling to find a time to meet?  Use Time poll to get control of your calendar by picking time slots that work for you.

People you invite will see times in their time zone, see how others have voted and mark the time slots that work for them.  When the Time poll closes, send an outcome with a calendar invitation to the meeting.
