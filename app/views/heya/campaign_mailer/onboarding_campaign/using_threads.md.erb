Hi 

Michael here again, I hope you have some first discussions underway within your group :-) 

Today I’d like to focus on threads.   Loomio threads have a wide range of uses - from a general discussion forum to holding specific work-flow and decision-making processes.

For example, you may frame a discussion on a particular topic, invite people to contribute their thoughts and opinions, and facilitate progress towards an agreed outcome.

    All info about a topic is in one easily accessible place.
    You can see who has read the thread and who needs a nudge.
    There is a record of discussion you can easily find again.

## Starting a thread
Starting a Loomio thread is like writing an email. The subject line of an email is like the thread title, and the text you write in an email is like the context of a thread.   As you would add people in the send list of your email, in Loomio you can invite people  to the thread, individually or as a group. They will receive an email notification with the content of your thread.

    People can reply to your thread via email and their comments will appear in the thread.

As with an email, a thread may be a simple question, or a more detailed introduction to a topic with links or files attached for background information.


## Respond and react
Encourage people by acknowledging their comments in the thread by replying to the comment or adding a reaction.   

At the top of the thread, you can see who has ‘seen’ the thread. Notice and reach out to people who haven’t yet engaged by mentioning and inviting their thoughts. 

## Keep the discussion alive
Keep an eye on progress of the discussion. You can update the thread context to help everyone see where the discussion has got to, and make it easier for new people to join in.   For important discussions, use ‘pin thread’ to keep it at the top of your group page.

Use the text formatting tools to emphasize key points.  Comments with ‘headings’ are automatically pinned to the timeline - and is an easy way to mark key milestones of the discussion.

## Invite-only threads
Although most threads will likely start within your Loomio group, you can also start an ‘invite-only’ thread where you can invite anyone to a private discussion - they do not need to be a member of your Loomio group.
