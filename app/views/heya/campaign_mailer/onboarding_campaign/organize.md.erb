Hi ,

Michael here again with my last email in this series.

I hope you have found these messages helpful as you get started with Loomio.   Please reply and let me know how you are doing, and if you need anything to help your Loomio group be successful.

With several threads, polls and decisions made or underway, you may now be thinking about how to keep your Loomio group fresh and on track.

## Managing threads

There are some tools on the group page to help you [manage threads](https://help.loomio.com/en/user_manual/groups/thread_management/index.html?utm_campaign=onboard&utm_medium=email).  Pin important threads to the top of the thread list, edit a thread to add a category tag, move a thread to another group, close old threads and delete unwanted threads.


## Managing members

Under the Members tab you can check on [group membership](https://help.loomio.com/en/user_manual/groups/membership/management.html?utm_campaign=onboard&utm_medium=email).  If a person has a particular role in the group, use set title to name the role, e.g. ‘Facilitator’.  Notice people who haven’t joined the group yet and resend the invitation.  I also recommend making at least one other person an admin for the group for when you are unavailable or leave the group.


## Subgroups

Help teams work productively in [Subgroups](https://help.loomio.com/en/user_manual/groups/subgroups/index.html?utm_campaign=onboard&utm_medium=email).  For example, you can use subgroups for the governance board, working group, project team or subcommittee.


## Inspiration
- [Good Governance Guide to Loomio](https://help.loomio.com/en/guides/board_processes/index.html?utm_campaign=onboard&utm_medium=email) to get started with your board or committee.
- [The Facilitator's Guide to Loomio](https://help.loomio.com/en/guides/facilitators_guide/index.html?utm_campaign=onboard&utm_medium=email) if you are engaging a network or group toward an intended outcome.

Need anything? Just reply and let me know  :-)

Warm regards, Michael
